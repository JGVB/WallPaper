The purpose of this app is to display an image(very large image scaled down) on the display of the iPhone.  
This image will be retrieved with AFNetworking(installed using cocoaPods) from google.  
There will also be an option to use nsurl to retrieve the image.
When you click on the image, a new one will cycle(from a list of urls)
The urls will be in json format from a server
